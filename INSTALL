libRadolan is a little C++ library for reading radar data in Radolan format.
The radolan format has been created by the German weather forecast service
(DWD) for it's radar composite data. For further information check:

1. Building libradolan

Libradolan's build process is governed by CMake (http://www.cmake.org/) in
order to make it easy to run on any computer. You will need a number of 
libraries installed before running cmake though:

	  - libz
	  - hdf5
	  - netcdf

Use your platform specific package managers to install those dependencies. 
CMake will look for the dependencies in the usual locations (/usr or /usr/local).
If you install dependencies in different locations, please consider the CMAKE
documentation and adjust the file CMakeLists.txt accordingly.

In order to create the makefiles, use the following command:

   cmake

in the project directory. After that, run:

   make all

In order to install the resulting libraries, use:

   make install

Note that the last command may require sudo privileges. The standard location
for the installation is /usr/local.
